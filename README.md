# network_app_classification
Master's thesis code for network application classification using supervised machine learning algorithms.

This series of scripts were used to conduct the experimental analysis of three supervised machine learning algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest) in classifying netflow traffic data according to the application generating such traffic.
